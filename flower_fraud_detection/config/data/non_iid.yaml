# Non-IID Data Partition Configuration
# @package data

partition_type: "non_iid"

# Non-IID partitioning strategy
# Options: "dirichlet", "label_skew", "quantity_skew", "pathological"
partition_strategy: "dirichlet"

# Dirichlet partition parameters
alpha: 0.5  # Lower = more skewed (0.1 = very skewed, 10.0 = nearly IID)
# Recommended values:
# - alpha = 0.1: Extremely non-IID (each client has very different distribution)
# - alpha = 0.5: Moderately non-IID (realistic scenario)
# - alpha = 1.0: Mildly non-IID
# - alpha = 10.0: Nearly IID

# Label skew settings (if using label_skew strategy)
num_labels_per_client: 2  # Number of classes each client has

# Quantity skew settings (if using quantity_skew strategy)
quantity_skew_factor: 0.3  # Higher = more variation in client data sizes

# Validation split
val_split: 0.2
shuffle: true
seed: 42
