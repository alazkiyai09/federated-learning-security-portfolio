# Aggregator Hyperparameters Configuration

# Coordinate-wise Median
median:
  # No hyperparameters needed

# Trimmed Mean
trimmed_mean:
  beta: 0.2  # Fraction to trim from each end (default: 0.2)
  # Robust to: beta × n attackers
  # Recommended values:
  #   - 0.1: Light trimming, more clients
  #   - 0.2: Balanced (default)
  #   - 0.3: Heavy trimming, fewer clients required

# Krum
krum:
  # No hyperparameters (uses num_attackers)
  # Robust to: floor((n-2)/3) attackers
  # Requirement: n >= 3f + 3

# Multi-Krum
multi_krum:
  m: 5  # Number of updates to select and average
  # If None, auto-computed as n - f - 2
  # Robust to: floor((n-2)/3) attackers (same as Krum)

# Bulyan
bulyan:
  # No hyperparameters (uses num_attackers)
  # Robust to: floor((n-1)/4) attackers
  # Requirement: n >= 4f + 1

# General settings
clients:
  min_clients: 10  # Minimum number of clients for robustness
  recommended_clients: 20  # Recommended for evaluation

# Attacker fractions to test
attacker_fractions: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]

# Training settings
training:
  rounds: 10  # Number of federated rounds
  local_epochs: 1  # Local training epochs per client
  learning_rate: 0.01
